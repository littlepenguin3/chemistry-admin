# Local Video Processing Pipeline

This deployment keeps all media on the local machine under `MEDIA_ROOT`. The API, `tusd`, and `video-worker` share that directory, while Postgres stores lifecycle state and artifact paths.

## Services

- `tusd`: mature tus resumable upload receiver. It writes completed uploads into `MEDIA_ROOT/tus`.
- `backend`: FastAPI service. It verifies exact SHA-256 identity, creates `media_assets`, and queues processing jobs.
- `video-worker`: local Docker worker. It claims queued jobs from Postgres and invokes mature media tools.

The worker image is built from a Python slim base and copies static `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries from a GitHub FFmpeg build archive during the Docker build. The worker verifies those binaries before claiming jobs. Video probing, thumbnail generation, remuxing, and transcoding are delegated to FFmpeg-family tools.

## Media Layout

```text
data/media/
  tus/<upload_id>
  originals/<asset_id>/source.<ext>
  renditions/<asset_id>/learning.mp4
  thumbnails/<asset_id>.jpg
  fingerprints/<asset_id>/video-signature.bin
  tmp/<job_id>/
```

Back up Postgres and `data/media` together. A database-only backup preserves metadata but not video files.

## Upload Flow

The admin web uses Uppy with tus support when `VITE_TUS_ENDPOINT` is configured. The browser can stream a SHA-256 precheck with `hash-wasm`; the backend remains authoritative and recomputes or verifies SHA-256 after the local upload handoff.

Original video uploads are limited by `MAX_MEDIA_UPLOAD_MB` (local default: 8192 MB). The teacher frontend reads the effective policy from the backend and rejects files above that size before hashing or tus upload starts. The backend still enforces the same limit for direct uploads and tus finalization.

Exact duplicates are byte-identical only. Different encodings of similar content are not exact duplicates and are never auto-skipped.

For local teacher-console builds, copy `apps/web-teacher/.env.example` to `apps/web-teacher/.env` or provide `VITE_TUS_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:10980/files/` in the build environment.

## Processing Policy

Default learning rendition:

- MP4 container
- H.264 video
- AAC audio
- `+faststart`
- max width `VIDEO_LEARNING_MAX_WIDTH` (default 1280)
- max frame rate `VIDEO_LEARNING_MAX_FPS` (default 30)
- CRF `VIDEO_LEARNING_CRF` (default 24)

Videos above `VIDEO_LEARNING_TRANSCODE_THRESHOLD_MB` or outside the compatible profile are transcoded. Already compatible MP4s are remuxed for playback. Originals are retained.

## Similarity Matching Boundary

Project code does not implement perceptual hashing, frame selection, temporal voting, or similarity math. The worker only calls the configured mature tool commands:

- `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMMAND`: receives `{input}` and `{output}` placeholders and must write a signature file.
- `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMPARE_COMMAND`: receives `{current}` and `{candidate}` placeholders and must print a numeric similarity score.
- `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_ALGORITHM`: label stored with signatures and duplicate candidates.
- `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`: score threshold for suspected duplicate rows.

The default worker image installs Meta ThreatExchange vPDQ support. Similarity tooling still stays behind a replaceable command boundary:

```text
VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMMAND=python -m server.app.video_similarity vpdq-signature "{input}" "{output}"
VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMPARE_COMMAND=python -m server.app.video_similarity vpdq-compare "{current}" "{candidate}"
```

The helper calls `threatexchange.extensions.vpdq.VPDQSignal` for hashing and comparison. It emits a conservative 0-1 score from the lower of the query-match and compared-match percentages, so a suspected duplicate generally needs both videos to match most of each other.

Suspected duplicates are advisory only. The system records candidates but never deletes, replaces, or skips teacher-selected media based on similarity.

## Library And License Notes

- Uppy core and Uppy tus client: MIT license; used for browser upload progress, retry, pause/resume, and tus client behavior.
- tusd: MIT license; used as the local tus receiver and offset/merge implementation.
- hash-wasm: MIT license; used for streaming SHA-256 exact duplicate precheck in the browser.
- FFmpeg/ffprobe: copied as static binaries from the configured GitHub FFmpeg archive at build time; used only as external media tools.
- Worker Python dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg[binary]`, `threatexchange`, and `vpdq`.
- vPDQ: Meta/ThreatExchange video PDQ implementation; used for suspected duplicate video matching.
- vPDQ: optional fallback candidate; packaging requires Linux build tooling and should stay inside the worker image if enabled.

Implementation review checklist:

- No custom chunk upload protocol or merge logic in FastAPI.
- No custom thumbnail extraction or transcoding logic outside FFmpeg/ffprobe calls.
- No project-owned pHash/dHash/frame-voting/video-hash implementation.
- Similarity commands must be replaceable through `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMMAND` and `VIDEO_SIMILARITY_COMPARE_COMMAND`.
- Suspected duplicate candidates must remain advisory until a teacher/admin records a decision.

## Operations

Start local services:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build backend tusd video-worker postgres
```

Restart the `backend` service after changing `MAX_MEDIA_UPLOAD_MB`; the teacher frontend displays the backend runtime policy, so it updates after the backend reloads the environment.

After the stack exists, rebuild only `video-worker` for worker code or dependency changes:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build video-worker
```

Queue non-blocking backfill jobs for existing ready media:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm -e VIDEO_WORKER_BACKFILL=1 video-worker
```

Retry a failed asset from the admin UI or call:

```http
POST /api/admin/media/assets/{asset_id}/retry-processing
```

## Rollback

Stop `video-worker` to pause processing:

```powershell
docker compose stop video-worker
```

Existing ready media continues to serve from `media_assets.playback_relative_path` or `media_assets.relative_path`. If resumable upload needs to be disabled during rollout, unset `VITE_TUS_ENDPOINT` and use the small-file fallback upload path.
