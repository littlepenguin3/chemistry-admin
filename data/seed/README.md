# Production Seed Resources

This directory contains the protected current-system resources for the chemistry admin platform. It is intentionally separate from historical `artifacts/` output so cleanup and refactor work has a stable source of truth.

Protected resource groups:

- `formal_experiments.json`: 77 current formal experiments.
- `knowledge_framework/`: 11 chapters, 133 knowledge units, 385 knowledge points, plus the reviewed curriculum source used to publish them.
- `experiment_points/`: 77 experiments and 300 current experiment points.
- `question_bank/`: the current reviewed point-aware question bank with 2310 questions and its schema.
- `point_evidence/`: the manually reviewed 300 point-to-canonical-chunk evidence bindings. The original path includes `video-point-default-evidence`, but the final reviewed JSONL is core learning evidence, not disposable video output.
- `canonical_rag/`: mirrored canonical chunks and embeddings from `E:/chemistry-rag/data/rag_ready`, including 3637 chunks/embeddings.
- `student_learning/`: explicit student-facing family and element learning profiles used by the H5 learning page; these display facts are curated seed data, not dynamically inferred from chunks.
- `import_reports/`: current import/validation reports retained for auditability.
- `manifests/core_resources.json`: count, size, and SHA256 manifest used as the cleanup guard.

Run this before cleanup or refactor work that touches resources:

```bash
python scripts/validate_production_resources.py
```

Regenerate the manifest only after intentionally replacing the protected seed resources:

```bash
python scripts/validate_production_resources.py --write-manifest
```
