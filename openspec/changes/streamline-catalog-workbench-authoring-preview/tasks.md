## 1. Contract Audit

- [x] 1.1 Inventory every backend reference to `student_description`, `card_image_asset_id`, `card_icon_key`, `card_accent`, `card_layout`, `card_presentation`, and `point_card_presentation`.
- [x] 1.2 Inventory every teacher frontend reference to student-card form values, `CatalogStudentCardPanel`, and `student-card` tab keys.
- [x] 1.3 Inventory every student frontend reference to removed card fields and identify derived replacements.
- [x] 1.4 Inventory tests and fixtures that currently assert manual card fields or card override behavior.
- [x] 1.5 Confirm whether the current migration system supports irreversible column drops and document the rollback assumption as database backup restore.

- [x] 2.6 Remove removed card fields from common catalog node select/read-model projections.
- [x] 2.7 Remove removed card fields from student catalog read models.
- [x] 2.8 Remove removed card fields from video-library search document builders.

## 3. Derived Student Catalog Cards

- [x] 3.1 Define derived directory card display rules using directory title, child availability, descendant count where available, and stable default visual treatment.
- [x] 3.2 Define derived point card display rules using point title, point learning summary where available, binary video presence, and bound video thumbnail where available.
- [x] 3.3 Update backend student catalog payloads so directory and point cards contain only remaining authoritative fields.
- [x] 3.4 Update `CatalogNodeCards` in `web-student` to render without removed fields.
- [x] 3.5 Replace point-card short description usage with a derived content summary or empty fallback.
- [x] 3.6 Replace card icon/accent/layout usage with stable defaults in the student frontend.
- [x] 3.7 Add student frontend tests for directory cards, point cards with summary/video thumbnail, and point cards with missing summary/video.
- [x] 3.8 Verify student catalog pages still render on phone widths without horizontal overflow after card derivation.

## 4. Teacher Preview Backend

- [x] 4.1 Add a teacher-authorized endpoint to create a short-lived preview token for a selected catalog point node.

- [x] 4.3 Add a preview point-detail read endpoint that returns a `StudentPointDetailResponse`-compatible payload for the scoped point.
- [x] 4.4 Ensure preview detail can render valid draft, unpublished, missing-content, and missing-video points for teacher inspection.
- [x] 4.5 Add preview media stream/thumbnail access that accepts only a valid preview token for the scoped point.
- [x] 4.6 Ensure preview APIs do not expose teaching notes, node-status diagnostics, ES/RAG internals, evidence chunks, generated queries, or job state.
- [x] 4.7 Ensure preview APIs do not start assessments, record progress, create feedback, open AI sessions, or mutate student data.
- [x] 4.8 Add backend tests for token scope, expiry, wrong-node rejection, no-teacher-diagnostic leakage, and preview media authorization.

## 5. Student Preview Shell

- [x] 5.1 Add a preview route or shell in `web-student` that accepts a preview token without creating a normal student session.
- [x] 5.2 Add a preview API client path that uses preview token authorization instead of `chem_student_token`.
- [x] 5.3 Reuse `CatalogPointDetailPanel` or factor its rendering so preview and normal student routes share the same point-detail composition.
- [x] 5.4 Add preview-only props or context to disable finish-learning, assessment handoff, feedback, and real AI chat actions.
- [x] 5.5 Add preview media URL helper that uses preview token media endpoints.
- [x] 5.6 Add controlled unavailable states for invalid, expired, or wrong-scope preview tokens.
- [x] 5.7 Ensure the student preview route can be embedded by the teacher preview shell using the approved internal origin/frame policy.
- [x] 5.8 Add student frontend tests proving preview mode renders point detail but does not call student mutation APIs.
- [x] 5.9 Verify normal student routes still use student auth and preserve assessment, AI, feedback, and related-point behavior.

## 6. Teacher Workbench Authoring IA

- [x] 6.1 Remove `CatalogStudentCardPanel` from the teacher catalog feature.
- [x] 6.2 Remove `student-card` from directory and point editor tab key lists.
- [x] 6.3 Change directory primary tabs to only `内容`.
- [x] 6.4 Change point primary tabs to exactly `内容`, `视频`, and `相关实验`.
- [x] 6.5 Remove student-card form values from teacher frontend types, hydration, update payload builders, and tests.
- [x] 6.6 Remove visible student-card status summary cards from the selected-node header.
- [x] 6.7 Keep compact content, video, related, and node-status summary information in the header without making diagnostics a tab.
- [x] 6.8 Update directory content panel so it no longer exposes student-facing card description or card presentation fields.

- [x] 6.10 Update editor-tab tests and contracts to assert the new tab sets.

## 7. Teacher Header Preview and Diagnostics

- [x] 7.1 Replace the disabled `预览学生端` header button with an enabled `预览学习卡片` action for point nodes.
- [x] 7.2 Wire `预览学习卡片` to the teacher preview-token endpoint and open a teacher preview window/shell for the selected point.
- [x] 7.3 Add `react-device-mockup` or an equivalent standard React device mockup dependency to the teacher frontend preview shell.

- [x] 7.10 Preserve existing node-status, AI-context, and advanced panel functionality inside the secondary diagnostics surface.
- [x] 7.11 Add fallback behavior when popup/window opening is blocked.
- [x] 7.12 Add teacher frontend tests for preview action availability, phone preset switching, diagnostics menu options, and absence of diagnostics in primary tabs.

## 8. Cleanup and Regression Tests

- [x] 8.1 Remove obsolete imports, CSS, tests, fixtures, and snapshots for manual student-card editing.
- [x] 8.2 Update TypeScript API types in teacher and student apps to match backend field removal.
- [x] 8.3 Update backend tests for catalog create/update/read/search contracts after field removal.
- [x] 8.4 Run backend migration and service tests covering catalog tree, student catalog, preview auth, media preview, and search documents.
- [x] 8.5 Run teacher frontend tests and typecheck.
- [x] 8.6 Run student frontend tests and typecheck.
- [x] 8.7 Run OpenSpec strict validation for this change.
- [x] 8.8 Rebuild affected Docker services and verify backend, web-teacher, and web-student health.

- [x] 9.2 Capture teacher workbench narrow laptop screenshots to verify header actions, tabs, and tree metadata do not collide.
- [ ] 9.3 Capture phone-sized preview screenshots for a complete point with video.
  - Blocked by current seed data: across 11 chapters and 393 catalog points, no point currently has a bound video (`hasVideoCount=0`). Captured the closest real states instead: missing-content/missing-video and content-complete/missing-video.

- [x] 9.5 Capture phone mockup preview screenshots for the default modern iPhone preset and at least one alternate phone preset.

- [x] 9.7 Verify preview does not expose teaching notes, raw RAG traces, validation internals, or backend job details.
- [x] 9.8 Verify preview does not trigger assessment, AI chat, feedback, or learning progress side effects.
