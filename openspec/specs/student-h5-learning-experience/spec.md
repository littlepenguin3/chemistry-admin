## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change student-h5-real-learning-experience. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Student H5 app configuration
The platform SHALL provide an authenticated student app configuration endpoint that exposes student-visible feature flags without exposing admin-only settings internals.

#### Scenario: Student loads app config
- **WHEN** an authenticated student requests the H5 app configuration
- **THEN** the response MUST include whether the AI assistant entry is visible
- **AND** it MUST include whether the feedback entry is visible
- **AND** it MUST include whether student AI capability is enabled

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated app config is rejected
- **WHEN** a request without a valid student token requests the H5 app configuration
- **THEN** the backend MUST reject the request using the normal student authentication rules

#### Scenario: H5 refreshes feature flags without WebSocket
- **WHEN** the student H5 app starts, regains focus, or changes major learning screens
- **THEN** it MUST refresh or reuse a recently refreshed app configuration
- **AND** it MUST hide AI or feedback entry points when the corresponding flag is disabled

### Requirement: Explicit student learning profile seed
The system SHALL keep display-facing family and element property facts in an explicit maintained seed resource instead of deriving H5 UI fields from RAG chunks at request time.

#### Scenario: Learning profile seed is validated
- **WHEN** production resource validation or test validation runs
- **THEN** every enabled student learning profile MUST include a chapter or family identifier, display title, summary, required property cards, and related property sections
- **AND** required property cards MUST cover atomic number, electron configuration, group, common valence, elemental state, and oxidizing/reducing tendency where applicable

#### Scenario: Backend loads profile facts
- **WHEN** the student learning API builds the H5 learning payload
- **THEN** it MUST read display facts from the explicit seed resource
- **AND** it MUST NOT depend on parsing canonical RAG chunk text to produce display facts

### Requirement: Real student learning page payload
The backend SHALL expose a student learning payload centered on a selected family or chapter profile and its chapter-scoped catalog tree.

#### Scenario: Student opens learning page
- **WHEN** an authenticated student opens the H5 learning page
- **THEN** the backend MUST return a recommended, default, or explicitly selected learning profile
- **AND** the payload MUST include the profile's visible family/element facts and common-property content where available
- **AND** it MUST include the top-level published catalog directory and point nodes for the current chapter.

- **AND** point node cards MUST include point/video learning entry metadata such as title, summary, media availability, and question count where available
- **AND** the view MUST NOT depend on a fixed parent experiment group level.

#### Scenario: No video exists for a point
- **WHEN** a published point node has no published video media
- **THEN** the H5 app MUST still show the point and its learning context
- **AND** it MUST render a graceful empty video state instead of failing navigation.

### Requirement: Student H5 mobile-first WebView contract
The student learning surface SHALL be treated as a phone-first H5 / mini-program WebView experience, not as a desktop admin page or a shrunken desktop layout.

#### Scenario: Student opens H5 on a phone viewport
- **WHEN** the student H5 app is viewed at common phone widths from 360px to 430px CSS pixels
- **THEN** primary learning screens MUST fit the viewport without horizontal scrolling
- **AND** headings, cards, segmented chapter switcher, bottom navigation, chat page, profile feedback, and action buttons MUST remain tappable and non-overlapping
- **AND** the layout MUST prioritize the phone flow: app-level tabs, current chapter context, A/B facts-or-experiments switching, experiment-point cards, point detail, chat, feedback, and assessment.

#### Scenario: Student uses touch-only interaction
- **WHEN** a student uses the app without hover, precise mouse input, or desktop keyboard shortcuts
- **THEN** all required learning, A/B switching, chat, feedback, login, password-change, pretest-skip, and logout actions MUST be reachable through touch controls
- **AND** interactive controls SHOULD use phone-appropriate hit areas and spacing.

#### Scenario: Desktop browser is used only for development preview
- **WHEN** a developer opens the student H5 app on a wide desktop browser
- **THEN** the app MAY center or constrain the phone layout for preview
- **BUT** it MUST NOT introduce desktop-only navigation, table-first layouts, hover-only affordances, or admin-console density into the student H5 experience.

### Requirement: Student experiment point detail
The student H5 app SHALL provide a point detail experience keyed by stable catalog point node identity.

#### Scenario: Student opens a point detail

- **AND** the app MUST preserve student learning event recording for post-learning behavior.
- **AND** the page MUST NOT render teacher-only notes.

#### Scenario: Point detail chat context is created
- **WHEN** a point detail page is open and AI assistant is enabled
- **THEN** the H5 app MUST pass chapter, point node id, optional source path, and page summary context to student chat requests
- **AND** it MUST NOT rely on legacy `experiment_id` plus `point_key` as the primary context.

#### Scenario: Directory is opened as point detail
- **WHEN** a student route or stale client attempts to open a directory node as a point detail
- **THEN** the app MUST render a controlled unavailable state or redirect to the directory page
- **AND** it MUST NOT request video, point knowledge, or assessment context for the directory.

### Requirement: Global authenticated H5 feedback
The student H5 app SHALL provide authenticated feedback from the `我的` profile destination when the feedback feature is enabled.

#### Scenario: Student submits feedback from profile
- **WHEN** an authenticated student submits feedback from `我的`

- **AND** it MUST capture feedback type, content, page path or screen, optional screenshot attachment, and any available route or learning context metadata
- **AND** the feedback MUST appear in the existing admin feedback management workflow.

#### Scenario: Student reports a page problem
- **WHEN** a student encounters a problem on a learning, experiment, assistant, or assessment page
- **THEN** the app MUST allow the student to report it through `我的` with a written description and optional screenshot
- **AND** the app MUST NOT require a current-page floating feedback widget to submit the report.

#### Scenario: Feedback switch is disabled
- **WHEN** the admin feedback switch is disabled
- **THEN** the H5 app MUST hide or disable the profile feedback entry after configuration refresh
- **AND** the backend MUST reject new student feedback submissions even if a stale client attempts one.

#### Scenario: Client cannot spoof student identity
- **WHEN** a student feedback request includes client-supplied student or class identity in metadata
- **THEN** the backend MUST derive the authoritative student and class identity from the authenticated token
- **AND** it MUST NOT trust client-supplied identity fields.

### Requirement: Current family chapter composition
The student H5 element learning page SHALL render as the learning page for one current family or chapter selected from the periodic-table learning entry, not as a primary sibling-family browsing surface.

- **THEN** the page MUST show the selected family or chapter as the current learning context
- **AND** it MUST NOT present sibling families as the page-level primary navigation
- **AND** it MUST provide a secondary way to return to or switch through the periodic-table learning entry.

#### Scenario: Student opens the default or recommended chapter
- **WHEN** no explicit profile is selected and the system resolves a default or recommended profile
- **THEN** the page MUST still render that profile as the current family or chapter
- **AND** it MUST NOT imply that the student is on a cross-family index page.

### Requirement: Within-family element selection
The student H5 element learning page SHALL let students select an element within the current family and view a model-led selected-element facts area for that element without changing the current family or chapter.

#### Scenario: Student selects an element chip

- **THEN** the page MUST prioritize compact summaries, expandable detail, or equivalent progressive disclosure
- **AND** it MUST keep the catalog task area discoverable without requiring excessive scrolling.

### Requirement: Optional licensed reference media
The student H5 element learning page SHALL treat public images, videos, or external reference resources as optional licensed reference media, not as protected experiment-point resources.

- **AND** these facts MUST NOT replace the catalog as the path to point video/detail learning.

### Requirement: Property sections are facts content
The student H5 learning page SHALL treat property sections as theory/common-property content rather than as the required primary grouping for experiment-point video learning.
