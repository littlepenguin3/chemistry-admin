- **THEN** default authoring fields MUST use teaching note wording wherever teacher-only remarks are collected
- **AND** student-facing descriptions MUST remain separate from teaching notes.

### Requirement: Modern catalog tree drag movement
The teacher catalog editor SHALL make node movement behave like a modern file-directory tree, with continuous drag feedback, navigable drop targets, immediate visible updates, and reliable reconciliation after persistence.

- **AND** a controlled warning MUST explain why the drop is unavailable when the teacher releases the node.

### Requirement: Selected-node summary adapts to catalog node purpose
The teacher catalog editor SHALL adapt the selected-node summary header to the selected node's purpose instead of rendering the same fixed metric blocks for directories and point nodes.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects a directory node
- **WHEN** a teacher selects a directory node
- **THEN** the summary header MUST identify it with a directory icon or equivalent visual cue
- **AND** it MUST emphasize structure and subtree readiness, such as child composition and publication-check state, rather than a large textual `目录` metric.

- **WHEN** a teacher changes between content, student card, video, publication check, or advanced panels
- **THEN** the switcher MUST make the active panel visually obvious
- **AND** the active panel content MUST remain part of the same right-side workbench rather than appearing as an unrelated floating card.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects a directory-only node
- **WHEN** a directory-only node is selected
- **THEN** the editor MUST keep directory-appropriate panel availability
- **AND** it MUST NOT show point-only video or learning-content panels solely because the switcher presentation changed.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects a point-capable node

- **AND** backend-derived annotation fields MUST reflect the edited suffix after preview or save.

### Requirement: Catalog editor diagnostic navigation uses retrieval wording
The teacher catalog editor SHALL distinguish point authoring from point retrieval diagnostics so teachers do not confuse editing content with AI/RAG/ES operational state.

- **WHEN** a teacher selects a point node in the catalog editor
- **THEN** the primary editor MUST continue to prioritize point title, three-element content, equation authoring, publication state, and video binding
- **AND** retrieval diagnostics MUST appear as a secondary tab, panel, or action with wording such as `点位检索诊断`.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects a directory node
- **WHEN** a teacher selects a directory node
- **THEN** the editor MUST focus on directory metadata, recursive point counts, movement, visibility, and child organization
- **AND** it MUST NOT present directory nodes as if they had the same point-level ES/RAG content diagnostics as experiment points.

#### Scenario: Teacher opens advanced diagnostics
- **WHEN** a teacher opens point diagnostics from the editor
- **THEN** the diagnostics surface MUST show ES/RAG/AI/search-preview state for the selected placement
- **AND** it MUST be clearly separated from default authoring controls so operational debug data does not crowd routine editing.

### Requirement: Catalog tree semantics are visible to retrieval diagnostics

- **WHEN** a teacher changes or inspects a directory that contributes to descendant point paths
- **THEN** diagnostics MUST be able to explain that descendant point placement documents may need reindexing
- **AND** the editor MUST avoid implying that a directory title change is purely cosmetic for search.

#### Scenario: Point publication changes from editor
- **WHEN** a teacher publishes, unpublishes, hides, or archives a point from the catalog editor
- **THEN** the editor MUST surface index/evidence state transitions through diagnostics or status badges
- **AND** it MUST preserve the existing save-vs-publish boundary for student search visibility.
