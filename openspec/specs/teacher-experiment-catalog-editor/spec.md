# teacher-experiment-catalog-editor Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change experiment-catalog-tree-point-architecture. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Point content autosaves like an online document
The teacher catalog editor SHALL autosave routine point and directory content edits while clearly separating save state from downstream ES/RAG sync state.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits point content
- **WHEN** a teacher changes point title, teaching note, principle mode, reaction equations, text principle, phenomenon explanation, or safety note
- **THEN** the editor MUST autosave the changed content without requiring a persistent `保存点位内容` button
- **AND** the visible save indicator MUST describe backend persistence using states such as `正在保存`, `已保存`, and `保存失败`.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits directory content
- **WHEN** a teacher changes a directory title or teaching note
- **THEN** the editor MUST autosave the changed directory content without requiring a persistent `保存目录内容` button
- **AND** the directory title editing interaction MUST keep the teacher in context rather than opening a separate title-edit window for routine inline edits.

#### Scenario: Autosave succeeds before downstream sync completes
- **WHEN** content is saved to the backend but ES or RAG has not yet consumed the change
- **THEN** the editor MUST still show the content save state as saved
- **AND** ES/RAG status MUST remain in diagnostics or secondary status surfaces rather than being represented as an unsaved content state.

#### Scenario: Autosave fails
- **WHEN** an autosave request fails validation or network persistence
- **THEN** the editor MUST show a save failure state near the edited content
- **AND** it MUST keep the teacher's current unsaved input available for correction or retry.

### Requirement: Autosave copy explains delayed search consumption
The teacher catalog editor SHALL explain that autosaved content and student search consumption are separate lifecycle states.

#### Scenario: Teacher views autosave help or sync diagnostics
- **WHEN** the editor shows helper copy, status details, or diagnostics for autosaved point content
- **THEN** the copy MUST say that routine edits are saved first and then consumed by ES/RAG asynchronously
- **AND** it MUST state the expected ES timing policy: normally after about 30 seconds without further edits, and at least once within about 3 minutes during continuous editing.

#### Scenario: Teacher views a published point after editing
- **WHEN** a published point has saved content changes that have not yet been consumed by ES/RAG
- **THEN** the editor MUST keep the point's publication status visually separate from sync status
- **AND** it MUST NOT imply that the point is unpublished, draft-only, missing video, or missing learning content merely because downstream sync is pending.

#### Scenario: Teacher opens retrieval diagnostics
- **WHEN** the teacher opens point diagnostics from the editor
- **THEN** the diagnostics surface MUST show ES and RAG states as downstream consumption states such as `已同步`, `待同步`, `同步中`, or `失败`
- **AND** it MUST not reuse the content autosave labels as if they were ES/RAG execution results.

### Requirement: Current video card shows left-aligned playback metadata
The teacher catalog editor SHALL present the current bound-video card like a mature video product: playable thumbnail first, then left-aligned title and student playback metadata beside it.

- **THEN** the current-video card MUST show the playable thumbnail on the left
- **AND** it MUST show exactly one prominent title block to the right of the thumbnail
- **AND** the title block MUST be left-aligned rather than horizontally centered in the empty right side
- **AND** the metadata under the title MUST include student playback file size when available
- **AND** the metadata MUST include upload time formatted to seconds, such as `2026-06-22 14:31:09`.

#### Scenario: Detailed playback facts are available
- **WHEN** the current binding payload includes bitrate, frame rate, codec, mime type, duration, or source-size comparison fields
- **THEN** the current-video card SHOULD show those facts as a compact one-property-per-line details list
- **AND** those facts MUST remain visually subordinate to the video title
- **AND** they MUST NOT duplicate the title or present the original file name as a second title.

#### Scenario: Playback resolution is available
- **WHEN** the current binding payload includes playback width and height
- **THEN** the current-video metadata MUST include the student playback resolution
- **AND** it MUST display the resolution as a compact fact near the playback size and upload time.

#### Scenario: Playback metadata is incomplete
- **WHEN** the current binding payload lacks playback size or resolution
- **THEN** the current-video card MUST omit only the missing fact or show a neutral pending-size message
- **AND** it MUST NOT show the original file name as a duplicate title line
- **AND** it MUST NOT imply that source size is the student playback size.

#### Scenario: Teacher manages the current binding
- **WHEN** the teacher needs to replace or remove the bound video
- **THEN** replace and remove actions MUST remain visually secondary
- **AND** the actions MUST stay anchored to the lower-right of the current-video information area without disturbing the title and metadata layout.

- **THEN** delete/remove and any precision reorder fallback commands MAY be available through a quiet hover action or `...` menu
- **AND** those fallback commands MUST remain visually secondary to the row title and source tag.

#### Scenario: Related experiment title is long
- **WHEN** a related experiment title is too long for the row
- **THEN** the title MUST truncate or wrap according to the list layout without colliding with the source tag or actions
- **AND** dragging, hovering, or opening actions MUST NOT resize the row in a way that shifts surrounding rows unexpectedly.

#### Scenario: Related experiments are defaults
- **WHEN** no manual related-link override has been saved
- **THEN** the panel MAY show the generated same-parent related experiments as compact rows or a controlled empty/default state
- **AND** the default rows MUST be clear enough to review and reorder without exposing raw link internals.

#### Scenario: Teacher adds a related experiment
- **WHEN** the teacher clicks the dashed add placeholder in the related experiments panel
- **THEN** the system MUST open a catalog tree picker in a modal or equivalent window
- **AND** the picker MUST show directory hierarchy with lazy-loaded children and point rows that can be selected
- **AND** the panel itself MUST NOT render an inline search box, inline search results region, or manual save button.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects a related experiment from the picker
- **WHEN** the teacher selects an eligible point node in the catalog tree picker
- **THEN** the point MUST be appended to the ordered related-experiment list as a manual related link
- **AND** the system MUST persist the updated related-link order immediately without requiring a separate save action
- **AND** the current point and already-selected related points MUST be disabled or ignored.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits related experiment membership or order
- **WHEN** the teacher removes a related experiment, reorders rows by drag/drop, uses a menu reorder fallback command, or resets the list to same-directory defaults
- **THEN** the system MUST persist the updated related-link payload immediately
- **AND** the UI MUST keep the compact ordered-list rhythm without adding a persistent save control.

#### Scenario: Visible instructional copy is rendered
- **WHEN** the related experiments panel renders headings or helper copy
- **THEN** visible copy MUST explain the learning-list purpose at most briefly
- **AND** it MUST NOT rely on prominent instructional text such as `拖动可调整顺序` to compensate for unclear interaction design.

### Requirement: Student-card authoring is removed from the teacher workbench
The teacher catalog editor SHALL remove manual student-card configuration as an authoring concept.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits a point
- **WHEN** a teacher selects a point node
- **THEN** the editor MUST NOT expose fields for point card short description, point card cover image, point card icon key, point card accent, or point card emphasis
- **AND** the editor MUST direct the teacher to preview the real learning card/page instead of manually configuring a card.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits a directory
- **WHEN** a teacher selects a directory node
- **THEN** the editor MUST NOT expose fields for student card description, card image asset id, card icon key, card accent, card layout, or card presentation
- **AND** directory presentation in the student catalog MUST be derived by the student read model and frontend defaults.

#### Scenario: Existing stale frontend code references student-card fields
- **WHEN** frontend tests or type checks inspect the catalog editor
- **THEN** no primary tab, form item, mapper field, or update payload MUST depend on removed student-card configuration fields.

### Requirement: Video tab shows a single current video slot
The teacher catalog editor SHALL present the point video tab as one current-video slot, because each catalog point can bind at most one video.

#### Scenario: Point has no bound video
- **WHEN** a teacher opens the video tab for a point with no active video binding
- **THEN** the tab MUST show an empty video slot or dashed placeholder inviting the teacher to choose a video
- **AND** it MUST NOT show a multi-select dropdown, batch bind button, or binding table.

#### Scenario: Point has a bound video
- **WHEN** a teacher opens the video tab for a point with an active video binding
- **THEN** the tab MUST show exactly one selected-video card or row with thumbnail, title, file name, upload/processing readiness, and preview access
- **AND** it MUST expose only visually secondary replace and remove actions.

#### Scenario: Bound video is processing or not ready
- **WHEN** the active binding's media asset is not ready
- **THEN** the selected-video slot MUST show the processing/unready state clearly
- **AND** it MUST avoid implying the video is already playable for students.

### Requirement: Teacher selects videos from a media picker
The teacher catalog editor SHALL use a media-library style picker for choosing or replacing a point video.

#### Scenario: Teacher chooses a video
- **WHEN** a teacher clicks the empty video slot or replace action
- **THEN** the editor MUST open a modal or equivalent picker listing existing video assets
- **AND** each selectable item MUST include a thumbnail or video placeholder, title, file name, upload/processing state, and preview affordance where available.

#### Scenario: Teacher searches videos
- **WHEN** a teacher types in the picker search field
- **THEN** the picker MUST filter or query video assets by title or file name
- **AND** it MUST keep metadata and thumbnail context visible in results.

#### Scenario: Teacher selects an eligible video
- **WHEN** a teacher selects a ready eligible video from the picker
- **THEN** the editor MUST immediately persist that video as the point's current video
- **AND** it MUST close the picker and keep the teacher on the video tab after detail refresh.

#### Scenario: Teacher inspects an unready video
- **WHEN** a video asset is still processing, failed, or otherwise not ready
- **THEN** the picker MAY show it for context
- **AND** it MUST disable or clearly prevent selecting it as a student-playable video until it is ready.

### Requirement: Video binding edits auto-save without binding publication controls
The teacher catalog editor SHALL make video selection, replacement, and removal direct persisted actions.

#### Scenario: Teacher replaces a video
- **WHEN** a teacher chooses a new video for a point that already has a current video
- **THEN** the editor MUST persist the replacement immediately
- **AND** it MUST show the replacement as the only current video after refresh.

#### Scenario: Teacher removes a video
- **WHEN** a teacher confirms removal of the current video
- **THEN** the editor MUST persist the removal immediately
- **AND** it MUST return the video tab to the empty slot state after refresh.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits video binding
- **WHEN** the video tab renders
- **THEN** it MUST NOT show binding-level `发布`, `取消发布`, `draft`, or `published` controls as authoring actions
- **AND** it MUST NOT require a separate save button after choosing or removing a video.

#### Scenario: Teacher needs to upload a new video
- **WHEN** a teacher needs a video that is not yet in the asset library
- **THEN** the video tab MAY provide a shortcut to the video resource page
- **AND** upload and processing MUST remain owned by the video resource workflow rather than embedded as the primary point binding action.

### Requirement: Point content form uses compact grouped authoring layout
The teacher catalog editor SHALL present point knowledge content as a compact grouped form while preserving existing chemical-equation authoring behavior.

#### Scenario: Teacher opens point knowledge content
- **WHEN** a teacher opens the `知识内容` panel for a point node
- **THEN** the form MUST visually group teacher-only note, experiment principle, and student-facing content as related authoring sections
- **AND** the teacher-only note MUST remain visibly secondary to student-facing point knowledge.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits equation principle mode
- **WHEN** the point principle mode is `化学方程式`
- **THEN** the editor MUST keep the existing natural multiline reaction input, debounced backend preview, AI assistance, suggestion adoption, inline annotation display, and autosave behavior
- **AND** the visible equation area MUST be compact enough that phenomenon explanation and safety note remain easy to reach in the same form.

#### Scenario: Principle controls render
- **WHEN** the experiment principle section is visible
- **THEN** the `化学方程式` / `文字描述` mode selector MUST be placed with the experiment-principle section heading or equivalent section controls
- **AND** the AI equation action MUST be placed with that same section control area when chemical-equation mode is active.

#### Scenario: Equation preview contains many rows
- **WHEN** backend preview returns multiple normalized reaction rows or AI candidates
- **THEN** the editor MUST keep row order visible and preserve per-row candidate adoption actions
- **AND** the preview area MUST use bounded scrolling or an equivalent compact treatment instead of expanding without limit and pushing the student-facing prose fields far down the page.

#### Scenario: Teacher edits student-facing prose
- **WHEN** the teacher edits `现象解释` or `安全提示`
- **THEN** both fields MUST remain textarea controls suitable for longer prose
- **AND** the fields MUST be presented as a coherent student-facing content group that can use two columns on wide surfaces and stack on constrained surfaces.

#### Scenario: Edit-content modal reuses the form
- **WHEN** the teacher opens the reused `编辑内容` modal
- **THEN** the modal MUST use the same content editing behavior as the main `知识内容` panel
- **AND** the layout MUST adapt without relying on sticky equation panes or oversized workbench spacing that would crowd the modal viewport.

### Requirement: Principle mode switching protects existing content
The teacher catalog editor SHALL require explicit confirmation before switching experiment principle mode when the current mode already contains authored content.

#### Scenario: Teacher switches away from equation content
- **WHEN** the current principle mode is `化学方程式`
- **AND** the reaction equation input contains non-empty content
- **AND** the teacher attempts to switch to `文字描述`
- **THEN** the editor MUST show a confirmation dialog explaining that current chemical-equation content will be cleared and only the selected mode will be saved
- **AND** it MUST NOT change the principle mode or autosave the mode switch unless the teacher confirms.
- **AND** the confirmation action MUST be visually marked as dangerous with the label `确认切换`, while the cancel action MUST use the label `放弃切换`.

#### Scenario: Teacher switches away from text principle content
- **WHEN** the current principle mode is `文字描述`
- **AND** the text principle field contains non-empty content
- **AND** the teacher attempts to switch to `化学方程式`
- **THEN** the editor MUST show a confirmation dialog explaining that current text content will be cleared and only the selected mode will be saved
- **AND** it MUST NOT change the principle mode or autosave the mode switch unless the teacher confirms.
- **AND** the confirmation action MUST be visually marked as dangerous with the label `确认切换`, while the cancel action MUST use the label `放弃切换`.

#### Scenario: Teacher switches from an empty mode
- **WHEN** the current principle mode has no authored content
- **AND** the teacher switches to the other principle mode
- **THEN** the editor MAY switch immediately without confirmation
- **AND** it MUST continue to save only the active principle mode.
